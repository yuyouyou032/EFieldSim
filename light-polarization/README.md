# Light Polarization Simulation

This project simulates circularly and elliptically polarized light as the sum of two light waves. It provides a framework for understanding the behavior of polarized light through numerical calculations and visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.py`: Entry point of the simulation. Initializes parameters and runs the simulation.
- `src/simulation.py`: Contains functions to calculate the resultant light wave from two light waves, including circularly and elliptically polarized light.
- `src/visualization.py`: Handles visualization of the simulation results, plotting light waves and their polarization states.
- `tests/test_simulation.py`: Unit tests for the functions in `simulation.py` to ensure accuracy of calculations.
- `data/output`: Directory for storing output data generated by the simulation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies required for the project.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, execute the following command:

```
python src/main.py
```

This will initialize the simulation and generate the results, which will be saved in the `data/output` directory.
